            <h3>Profesonal front-End Developer</h3>
            <p>Hello there! My name is Jahid Khan, and I’m a front end developer based in bangladesh. I do enjoy building responsive, modern and clean looking web pages using technologies like Html5 , Bootstrap 5, CSS3, JavaScript, React and many others. If you’ve got a PSD of your website or just a mock-up in your head - it would be my pleasure to make either of them come true.
